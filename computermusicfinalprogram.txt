CSGO: Taiko experiments with using player data from recorded Counter-Strike: Global Offensive games to drive a drum track generated in ChucK.

This installment currently uses a text dump and file parsing to grab the desired data from the demo of choice. It serves as a proof-of-concept for the potential to use sound as a tool to help players prevent mistakes from past experiences.
