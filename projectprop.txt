CSGO Demo XY Proj

What will it do:

Layer 1:
Play some default ambient sounds
Provide some sort of distortion/static in static locations

Layer 2:
Provide intuition for bad places to be or confrontational areas
Provide more information to an underused sense while in game

Layer 3:
Provide a stepping stone to hooking real time audio generation on client game data
Potentially help music and sound become an integral part of a game experience as opposed to an afterthought
